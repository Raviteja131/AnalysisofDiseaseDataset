Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Disease Dataset

This EDA aims to provide a thorough examination of a dataset containing information about disease prevalence across various districts and areas, including fields such as disease type, district, area, disease rate, and percentage. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution, relationships, and potential insights within the data.

1. Data Overview and Structure
   
The dataset contains 50 entries with five columns: Disease, District, Area, Disease Rate, and Percentage.

An initial review shows no missing values, and the data types are appropriate for analysis, with numerical columns (Disease Rate and Percentage) and categorical columns (Disease, District, and Area).

3. Descriptive Statistics

Key statistics, such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum values for Disease Rate and Percentage, provide insights into the range and central tendency. The Disease Rate has a mean of 11.78 and ranges from 8.2 to 17.2, while the Percentage has a mean of 62.73, ranging from 40.8 to 91.1.

5. Univariate Analysis

Distribution of Disease Rate: A histogram with a KDE plot illustrates that Disease Rate values are approximately normally distributed, with most rates clustering around the mean of 11.78.

Distribution of Percentage: The percentage values show a right-skewed distribution, suggesting that most areas have lower percentages, with fewer high percentages related to disease prevalence.

6. Bivariate Analysis

Disease Rate by Disease: A box plot shows the distribution of Disease Rate for each disease, providing a comparison of typical rates by disease. This can help identify diseases with relatively higher or lower prevalence rates.

Percentage by Disease: Similarly, a box plot displays the variation in Percentage for each disease, highlighting differences across diseases.

Disease Rate vs. Percentage: A scatter plot with color coding for diseases shows the relationship between Disease Rate and Percentage, suggesting potential correlations and how each disease clusters within this relationship.

7. Correlation Analysis

A heatmap of the correlation matrix reveals the relationship between Disease Rate and Percentage. This visual can indicate whether high rates are often accompanied by high percentages, which could suggest an underlying relationship between these metrics.

8. District-Level Analysis

Average Disease Rate by District: A bar chart illustrates the mean Disease Rate for each district, showing which districts experience higher or lower average rates. This could be valuable for identifying districts with notably high disease prevalence.

Conclusion

This EDA provides a foundational understanding of disease prevalence patterns across districts and areas, highlighting distributions, disease relationships, and district-specific insights. The findings reveal valuable data points that can help focus on specific diseases or regions for targeted healthcare interventions or further research.
